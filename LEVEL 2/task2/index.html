            With his in-house studio Panchathan Record Inn, Rahman's film-scoring career began during 
            the early 1990s with the Tamil film Roja. Following that, he went on to score several 
            songs for Tamil language films, including Ratnam's politically charged Bombay, the urban 
            Kadhalan, Thiruda Thiruda, and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman. Rahman's score for his 
            first Hollywood film, the comedy Couples Retreat (2009), won the BMI Award for Best Score.

        </p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p style="font-size:medium;" >
            Allah Rakha Rahman was born as A. S. Dileep Kumar in Madras, Tamil Nadu, on 6 January 1967.
            His father, R. K. Shekhar from a Mudaliar family, was a film-score composer and conductor for 
            Tamil and Malayalam films. Rahman began studying piano at age four. He assisted his father in 
            the studio, playing the keyboard.
            <br><br>
            After his father's death when Rahman was nine years old, the rental of his father's musical 
            equipment provided his family's income. Raised by his mother, Kareema (born Kashturi), Rahman, 
            who was studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan had to work to support his family, which led to 
            him to routinely miss classes and fail exams. In an interview in 2012, Rahman said that his mother 
            was summoned and was told to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to 
            the school any more.
            <br><br>
            Rahman attended another school called MCN for a year and later joined the Madras Christian College 
            Higher Secondary School, where he was admitted on his music talent and formed a band with his high 
            school classmates. However, after discussing with his mother, he later dropped out of school to 
            pursue a career as a full-time musician. Rahman was a keyboard player and arranger for bands such 
            as Roots (with childhood friend and percussionist Sivamani, John Anthony, Suresh Peters, JoJo and 
            Raja) and founded the Chennai-based rock group Nemesis Avenue.He mastered the keyboard, piano, 
            synthesizer, harmonium and guitar, and was particularly interested in the synthesizer because 
            it was the "ideal combination of music and technology".
            <br><br>
            Rahman began his early musical training under Master Dhanraj and at age 11 began playing in the 
            orchestra of Malayalam composer (and close friend of his father) M. K. Arjunan. He soon began working 
            with other composers, such as M. S. Viswanathan, Vijaya Bhaskar, Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu, Vijay Anand, 
            Hamsalekha and Raj-Koti, accompanied Zakir Hussain, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan and L. Shankar on world tours 
            and obtained a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music. During his early 
            career, Rahman had assisted many music directors to play keyboard and synthesizer. One of the notable 
            works includes a Malayalam film, Ramji Rao Speaking released in 1989 where Rahman and Sivamani programmed 
            a song called "Kalikalam" for the music director S.Balakrishnan.
        </p>
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Soundtracks</h3><br>
        <p style="font-size:medium;" >
          Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television
          channels. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn.
          He also arranged the jingles for some advertisements that went on to become very popular, including the popular 
          jingle for Titan Watches, in which he used the theme from Mozart's Symphony no.25

          released his first film soundtrack, Roja, in 1992.
          <br><br>
          In 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film, Roja.
          Rahman's film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. 
          It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India, and arguably one of Asia's most sophisticated and 
          high-tech studios. Cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for his second film Yoddha, a Malayalam film 
          starring Mohanlal and directed by Sivan's brother Sangeeth Sivan that released in September 1992.
          <br><br>
          The following year, Rahman received the National Film Awards (Silver Lotus) award for best music director at the 
          National Film Awards for Roja. The films' score was critically and commercially successful in its original and dubbed
          versions, led by the innovative theme "Chinna Chinna Aasai". Rahman followed this with successful scores and songs 
          for Tamil language films for the Chennai film industry, including Ratnam's politically charged Bombay, Thiruda Thiruda 
          and S. Shankar's debut film Gentleman (with its popular dance song, "Chikku Bukku Rayile"), the urban Kadhalan. 
          Rahman collaborated with director Bharathiraaja on Kizhakku Cheemayile and Karuththamma, producing successful Tamil 
          rural folk-inspired film songs; he also composed for K. Balachander's Duet, which had some memorable Saxophone themes.
          The 1995 film Indira and romantic comedies Mr. Romeo and Love Birds also drew attention.
          Rahman attracted a Japanese audience with Muthu's success there. His soundtracks are known in the Tamil Nadu film 
          industry and abroad for his versatility in combining Western classical music, Carnatic and Tamil traditional and 
          folk-music traditions, jazz, reggae and rock music. The soundtrack for Bombay sold 15 million copies worldwide and 
          "Bombay Theme" would later reappear in his soundtrack for Deepa Mehta's Fire and a number of compilations and other 
          media. It was featured in the 2002 Palestinian film Divine Intervention and the 2005 Nicolas Cage film, Lord of War. 
          Rangeela, directed by Ram Gopal Varma, was Rahman's Bollywood debut. Successful scores and songs for Dil Se.. and the 
          percussive Taal followed. Sufi mysticism inspired "Chaiyya Chaiyya" from the former film and "Zikr" from his 
          soundtrack album for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero (which featured elaborate orchestral and choral 
          arrangements).
          <br><br>
          Rahman's soundtrack album for the Chennai production Minsaara Kanavu won him his second National Film Award for Best 
          Music Direction and a South FilmFare Award for Best Music Direction in a Tamil film in 1997, the latter setting a record 
          of six consecutive wins; he later went on to win the award three consecutive additional times. The musical cues in the 
          soundtrack albums for Sangamam and Iruvar used Carnatic vocals, the veena, rock guitar and jazz. During the 2000s, 
          Rahman composed scores and popular songs for Rajiv Menon's Kandukondain Kandukondain, Alaipayuthey, Ashutosh Gowariker's 
          Swades, Rang De Basanti and songs with Hindustani motifs for 2005's Water. Rahman has worked with Indian poets and 
          lyricists such as Javed Akhtar, Gulzar, Vairamuthu and Vaali, and has produced commercially successful soundtracks with 
          directors Mani Ratnam and S. Shankar (Gentleman, Kadhalan, Indian, Jeans, Mudhalvan, Nayak, Boys, Sivaji, Enthiran, I and 
          2.0).
          <br><br>
          In 2005 Rahman expanded his Panchathan Record Inn studio by establishing AM Studios in Kodambakkam, Chennai, creating the 
          most cutting-edge studio in Asia. The following year he launched his own music label, KM Music, with his score for 
          Sillunu Oru Kaadhal. Rahman scored the Mandarin-language film Warriors of Heaven and Earth in 2003 after researching 
          and using Chinese and Japanese classical music, and won the Just Plain Folks Music Organization|Just Plain Folks Music

          the songs "Jai Ho" and "O... Saya" from its soundtrack were internationally successful. His music on 2008's Bollywood 
          Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na was popular with Indian youth; that year, his score and songs for Jodhaa Akbar won critical 
          acclaim, a Best Composer Asian Film Award nomination and IIFA awards for best music direction and score.
